--V I'll let Vhou decide--
- Against everyone's better judgement, let Sky take care of implementing Version 2.0 Cog calculation behavior! They are very sorry.
 - V2.0 Cogs will, in a future update, take reduced damage from each gag used by a factor of 2*level.
  - At least, probably. This is still in a development phase and is subject to change at any time.
 - As of right now, this calculation functionality is useless for practical gameplay. Go ahead and find some new combos to use ahead of time, however!
- Accidentally deleted keybinds in the process of doing this.
- Added back keybinds and a heartfelt apology.
