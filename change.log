--Toontown Gag Damage Calculator V2.0.0--

- Live calculation is now here! The calculate button is a thing of the past.
- Several incorrect gag damage values have been fixed both visually and mathematically.
 - Bugle
 - Marbles
 - Quicksand
- The dropdowns are the same size as everything else! How cool is that?!
- Updating lure damage bonus to be accurate to the latest versions of Toontown Rewritten.

--V2.0.0a--
- More incorrect gag damage values have been fixed.
 - Squirting Flower
 - Cream Pie Slice

--V2.1--
- Added number indicators for how many of each gag is used in a given turn.

--V2.2--
- SOS Cards are real
- Fixed Bugle (again)

--V2.2.1--
- Keybind for organic toggle
- Keybind for def toggle
- Keybind for calculation reset
- Keybind for lure toggle

--V2.3--
- V2 Calculation - might not work as intended, please test it out in cog golf courses and let me know if there's any issues.
- Reworked how the level indicator works to make it easier to add higher level cogs in the future.

--V3--
- Moved math funcitons to mod/calculators.py
- Added version.txt for future update checking, maybe?

--V3.1.0--
- Added the update checker. It is accessed through the new menu bar under "Program."

--V3.1.1--
- Changed the naming system of variables and functions to snake_case for more readability
- Added "Exit" menu option under Program menu bar.

--V3.2.0--
- Created gags.py, which stores gag objects. Gag objects have type, name, track, and dmg. They also have method .makeorg(), which will evaluate the organic damage of the gag object.
- Made gag buttons more efficient by removing individual functions and making a single that applies to every button.
- With these changes, there's probably some kind of new (or old, unnoticed) issue out there. Please submit any such issue you find.

--V3.2.1--
- Bugfix: Fixed gag history displaying incorrectly if a gag was organic or not after using it as organic once.
- Moved "Pin Window" button to the Program menu. More things will probably be moved into the menu bar at some point.
- Pin window has also been given a keybind- alt+up

--V3.3.0--
- settings.toml! This will store personal settings for the gag calculator!
- Keybinds are stored here- it's now possible to edit keybinds by changing this file instead of having to use the ones I created. Note that keybinds are currently only editable through settings.toml and are configured at launch. If a keybind is not possible, the program will crash immediately with an error that looks like: '_tkinter.TclError: bad event type or keysym "Shfit_L".'
- The program now requires an external library: tomli.

--V3.3.2--
- Added a new level of defense.

--V4.0.0--
- Converted several modules to Rust.
- Removed tomli dependency
- Moved V2, Defense, and Status Locking to the new Calculations menu

--V4.1.0--
- Upgraded to Python 3.11
- Fixed a bug with V2.0 cog calculation
