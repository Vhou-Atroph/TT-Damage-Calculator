# Contributing to TT-Damage-Calculator

The preferred way to contribute to the Toontown Damage Calculator is through reporting bugs and requesting features on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Vhou-Atroph/TT-Damage-Calculator/issues)!

To submit an issue, click on the "New issue" button and select whether your issue is a bug report, or a feature request. It is highly recommended to follow the template provided to ensure clear communication! If your issue is a bug report, a screenshot can be very helpful for identifying what problem you are experiencing.

In the submission of multiple bugs, please make an issue for each one! This will help make sure it's easy to track when each individual bug has been fixed.

When submitting your issue, please keep swearing and other profane language to a minimum. Running into problems can be frustrating, but the issue tracker isn't the place for venting these frustrations- it's for identifying bugs, or thinking of potential enhancements for the program!
