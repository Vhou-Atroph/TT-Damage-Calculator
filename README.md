### What if I don't want to build the program?

For some versions of the calculator, I will compile it completely and release a standalone executable for users who either do not want to or are unable to compile the dependencies themselves. You can find the latest release at <https://github.com/Vhou-Atroph/TT-Damage-Calculator/releases/latest>.

## Usage

### Gag Selection

Click any gag on the grid to add it to the calculation.

### Statuses/Modifiers

There are three buttons available above the gag selection that allow for certain functionalities: if a cog being lured that round, whether a gag is organic or not, and the ability to reset the current calculation. Other cog modifiers such as defense and v2 level can be found in the menu bar under "Calculations."

### Other Features

There are two buttons in the bottom right corner of the program.  
'Clear History' will clear all text in the History panel, which logs previous calculations.  
'Show Health and SOS Cards' brings up a grid of all cog health values from Level 7 to Level 20, as well as the major SOS cards for Trap, Sound, and Drop. This can be toggled by clicking on it a second time.

The program has various keybinds to expedite calculation:
| Keybind     | Description         |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| shift       | Toggle Organic      |
